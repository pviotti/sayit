# SayIt :loudspeaker:

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/pviotti/gh-pipelines/_apis/build/status/pviotti.sayit?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/pviotti/gh-pipelines/_build/latest?definitionId=3&branchName=master)  

SayIt is a simple command line tool that pronounces written text.
You can use it to create audio recordings of your text files or
to improve your pronunciation in a foreign language.

## Installation

SayIt uses [Azure Cognitive Services][az-cs] as backend to guarantee
optimal audio quality, so it requires a subscription to Azure, which you can get for free
[here][az-sub].
Azure Cognitive Services [free tier][az-cs-price] includes 5 text-to-speech
hours per month, which is often enough for personal use.  

You can download SayIt in the [release section][release]. 
SayIt is currently distributed as self-contained .NET Core executable, 
which means you won't need to install the .NET Core runtime to use it.

## Usage

```bash
$ ./sayit --help
USAGE: sayit [--help] [--setup] [--version] [--voice <en|it|fr>] [--output <output>] <input>

INPUT:

    <input>               the text to be pronounced

OPTIONS:

    --setup               setup configuration file
    --version             print sayit version.
    --voice, -v <en|it|fr>
                          specify the voice.
    --output, -o <output> output file.
    --help                display this list of options.
```
At the first use you're required to run the setup wizard (`./sayit --setup`) 
and enter the configuration parameters of your Azure Cognitive Services subscription,
which are the subscription Id and the region moniker. SayIt will store this parameters in the configuration folder of the current
user (e.g. `~/.config/` in Linux) as an [App Setting XML file][appsetting].

SayIt currently supported settings: 
 - languages: English, Italian and French.
 - audio export formats: MP3 16Khz 32KB/s mono
